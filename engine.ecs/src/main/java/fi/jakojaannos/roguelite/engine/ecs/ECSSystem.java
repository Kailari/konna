/**
 * A single stateless logical unit, performing a data transformation procedure on collections of
 * {@link Component components} based on groupings called {@link Entity entities}. Provides a {@link
 * #tick(Stream, World, double) tick}-method for applying the state update on compatible entities.
 * <p>
 * Systems should never be manually ticked outside of a test environment. Instead, a {@link
 * SystemDispatcher dispatcher} should be used, as it automatically handles managing dependencies
 * and resource requirements. All system instances must be registered when constructing the
 * <code>SystemDispatcher</code> with the {@link SystemDispatcher#builder() Dispatcher builder}.
 * <p>
 * Systems are stateless. Having any persistent per-world state-full data on systems is strictly
 * prohibited. If you need cached results for an expensive calculation, use a {@link Resource}. It
 * is allowed, however, to have fields for temporary variables to avoid constant allocations. Such
 * variables should be named accordingly, and current convention is to prefix those with "tmp". For
 * example, system which often calculates some direction vector, could have field <code>private
 * final Vector2d tmpSomeDirection</code>, which is then recycled. Care must be taken for recycled
 * objects old state not accidentally affecting other entities.
 * <p>
 * System dependencies are defined in {@link #declareRequirements(RequirementsBuilder)} via a {@link
 * RequirementsBuilder}. Typically, systems should be designed so that execution order does not
 * matter. However, in order to achieve deterministic, predictable behavior, it is sometimes
 * necessary to give the dispatcher hints on the order in which the systems should be executed. For
 * these cases, {@link SystemGroup groups} and a number of {@link RequirementsBuilder#tickAfter(Class)
 * methods} {@link RequirementsBuilder#tickAfter(SystemGroup) for} {@link
 * RequirementsBuilder#tickBefore(Class) controlling} {@link RequirementsBuilder#tickBefore(SystemGroup)
 * the order} of execution. <strong>These methods are to be used sparingly, as the dependency tree
 * should be kept as shallow as possible.</strong> Defining dependencies is not something that can
 * outweigh clever systems design, but a tool to be used to ensure that resources are updated in
 * consistent order.
