Feature: The player can see how long they have survived on the HUD

  There is a simple timer on middle-top of the screen, telling the player how long they have been
  fighting on. The timer has HH:MM:SS format, where minutes and seconds tick up to 60. Minutes or
  hours should not be visible until they are relevant. Minutes and seconds should be padded with
  leading zeros.
